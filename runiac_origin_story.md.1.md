# Origin Story

## How it began (we're on the right path)

- The year was 2018, talk about public cloud being a reality, we had the benefit of learning from the prior 10 years and other fortune 500 adopters.  Starting off right with highly mature CI/CD practices with everything configured as code.  Following the success of doing this in another team, we went all in on Jenkins with highly sophisticated pipeline files with a custom YAML configuration layer.

## What happened (we can see the road but can't find it)



## A Fresh Look

Appreciating we were building the foundation of a fortunate 6 healthcare company's public cloud presence that will last for many years to come.  We approached our delivery needs with a fresh look.  The resulting mission, create an environment where:

- No pipeline code needed [after initial creation]
- An easy to use, meaningful local development environment

## Runiac

From this mission, runiac was born.
