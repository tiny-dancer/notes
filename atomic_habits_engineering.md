# Atomic Habits in Building Software

Can you count how many layers there are now in software products?  3, 4, 10?  So many!  
Working in technology systems with the many layers expanding from our code to open source, to cloud providers, to operating systems, to hardware, to machine code there is no shortage of layers and complexity.  We code dumpster divers quickly learn to appreciate identifying the root cause of an issue to effectively move forward, avoiding the swirl of symptom solving.  James Clear brings this same attitude in Atomic Habits when it comes to hacking biological systems, yourself.

If you are as interested as I am in self improvement, I highly recommend grabbing the book and enjoying the ride.  Additionally Hidden Brain had a great episode on the topic (linked below. 

From here we'll have some fun taking the most powerful messages of the book and applying them to the vast world of software engineering.

## You do not rise to the level of your goals.  You fall to the level of your systems

> In atomic habits, systems in the quote refers to our biologically developed *habitual systems*

**Atomic Habits**:  As aspirational our goals and commitment are,  research has shown what truly drives change is our habits.  Habits developed incrementally over time are performed on auto-pilot, therefore inevitably as our resolve deteriorates, our habits kicked in.  The optimized route for introducing effective change into our life therefore is to introduce change into our habitual system.  For example, focus your primary attention on exercising 15 minutes in the moring before coffee _instead_ of focusing on a goal to lose to "20 lbs".  Drive change in your habitual system to fulfill your goals. 


**Tech Product**:  Your system is as strong as your weakest link.   Our product does not rise to the level of our incredible features (goals) but will fall to the level of our system (our defects and site reliability).  It is imperative that we maintain a high level quality.  Sales goals, marketing goals, product goals, engineering goals, and even our features are all irrelevant to the user experiencing an issue here and now. 

In the user experience world, this applies to quality empty and error states.
In the development and engineering world, this applies to high levels of site reliability engineering: resiliency, awareness and performance.

## We often dismiss small changes because they don’t seem to matter very much in the moment

**Atomic Habits**:  

**Tech Product**:  : 
- Momentum, momentum, momentum.  Every little change matters and adds up to a growing snowball effect. This is true both in subtle enhancements to the user experience as well as internal processes.

## It’s only by making the fundamentals of life easier that you can create the mental space needed for free thinking and creativity

This may be the most important one when applied in the technology world.  The product will struggle to evolve and be successful if engineers are spending time fighting fires and struggling to release code consistently.  The foundations (CI/CD, DevOps, Site Reliability and team enablement) need to be put in place early and often to ensure the team can focus on free thinking and creativity to solve _human_ problems. 

## Before we can effectively build new habits, we need to get a handle on our current ones

This is important lesson in scope creep and prioritization.  Before a product adds new features we need to ensure the existing ones are working effectively, this can include both user value/adoption and reliability .  If they are not being adopted, we could even consider removing them to lower the overall care and feeding "cost" prior to adding new features.  

## One of the most effective things you can do to build better habits is to join a culture where your desired behavior is the normal behavior

> Culture Eats Strategy for Breakfast.

Culture is HUGE.  Focus on improving the culture.  It's hard to introduce positive change if you're the organization is not open to receiving it.

## It is easy to get bogged down trying to find the optimal plan for change: the fastest way to lose weight, the best program to build muscle, the perfect idea for a side hustle.  We are so focused on figuring out the best approach that we never get around to taking action


MVP, Agile: small iterative progress.  What we believe may be most valuable to the users may end up evolving to something completely different, slowly work your way there, adapting quickly so it looks like it is what you planned all along.


## Standardize before you optimize.  You can’t improve a habit that doesn’t exist

In the technology world, optimize often means automation.  And you cannot automate without standardizing.

## The human brain evolved to prioritize immediate rewards over delayed rewards

Be aware of the long term ramifications of quick wins.  They may prove valuable for the right reasons but make sure you understand the pro's and con's before blindly plowing forward.

## Your  outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits.
