# Atomic Habits and Software Engineering


Working in technology systems with the many layers expanding from our code to open source, to cloud providers, to operating systems, to hardware, to machine code there is no shortage of layers and complexity.  We code dumpster divers quickly learn to appreciate identifying the root cause of an issue to effectively move forward, avoiding the swirl of symptom solving.  James Clear brings this same attitude in Atomic Habits when it comes to hacking biological systems, yourself.

If you are as interested as I am in self improvement, I highly recommend grabbing the book and enjoying the ride.  Additionally Hidden Brain had a great episode on the topic (linked below. 

From here we'll have some fun taking the most powerful messages of the book and applying them to the vast world of software engineering.

## You do not rise to the level of your goals.  You fall to the level of your systems

> In atomic habits, systems in the quote refers to our biologically developed *habitual systems*

**Atomic Habits**:  As aspirational our goals and commitment are,  research has shown what truly drives change is our habits.  Habits developed incrementally over time are performed on auto-pilot, therefore inevitably as our resolve deteriorates, our habits kicked in.  The optimized route for introducing effective change into our life therefore is to introduce change into our habitual system.  For example, focus your primary attention on exercising 15 minutes in the moring before coffee _instead_ of focusing on a goal to lose to "20 lbs".  Drive change in your habitual system to fulfill your goals. 


**Software Engineering**: This can be applied in two ways

1) Your system is as strong as your weakest link.  Sales goals, marketing goals, product goals, engineering goals, are all worthless to the here and now. Always ensure a strong foundation.  The goals of our technology product are the features.  This is an important message that our product does not rise to the level of our incredible features (goals) but will fall to the level of our system (the defects and site reliability).
