# Atomic Habits and Software Engineering


Working in technology systems with the many layers expanding from our code to open source, to cloud providers, to operating systems, to hardware, to machine code there is no shortage of layers and complexity.  We code dumpster divers quickly learn to appreciate identifying the root cause of an issue to effectively move forward, avoiding the swirl of symptom solving.  James Clear brings this same attitude in Atomic Habits when it comes to hacking biological systems, yourself.

If you are as interested as I am in self improvement, I highly recommend grabbing the book and enjoying the ride.  From here we'll have some fun taking the most powerful messages of the book and applying them to the vast world of software engineering.
