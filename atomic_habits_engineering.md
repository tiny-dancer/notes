# Atomic Habits and Software Engineering


Atomic Habits was a special book.  Working in technology systems with the many layers expanding from our code to open source, to cloud providers, to operating systems, to hardware, to machine code there is no shortage of layers and complexity.  We code dumpster divers quickly learn to appreciate identifying the root cause of an issue to effectively move forward, avoiding the swirl of symptom solving.  James Clear brings this same attitude in Atomic Habits when it comes to hacking biological systems, our own self.
