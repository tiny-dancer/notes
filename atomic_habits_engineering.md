# Atomic Habits and Software Engineering


Working in technology systems with the many layers expanding from our code to open source, to cloud providers, to operating systems, to hardware, to machine code there is no shortage of layers and complexity.  We code dumpster divers quickly learn to appreciate identifying the root cause of an issue to effectively move forward, avoiding the swirl of symptom solving.  James Clear brings this same attitude in Atomic Habits when it comes to hacking biological systems, yourself.

If you are as interested as I am in self improvement, I highly recommend grabbing the book and enjoying the ride.  Additionally Hidden Brain had a great episode on the topic (linked below. 

From here we'll have some fun taking the most powerful messages of the book and applying them to the vast world of software engineering.

## You do not rise to the level of your goals.  You fall to the level of your systems

> In atomic habits, systems in the quote refers to our biologically developed *habitual systems*

**Atomic Habits**:  As aspirational our goals and commitment are,  research has shown what truly drives change is our habits.  Habits developed incrementally over time are performed on auto-pilot, therefore inevitably as our resolve deteriorates, our habits kicked in.  The optimized route for introducing effective change into our life therefore is to introduce change into our habitual system.  For example, focus your primary attention on exercising 15 minutes in the moring before coffee _instead_ of focusing on a goal to lose to "20 lbs".  Drive change in your habitual system to fulfill your goals. 


**Tech Product**:  Your system is as strong as your weakest link.   Our product does not rise to the level of our incredible features (goals) but will fall to the level of our system (our defects and site reliability).  It is imperative that we maintain a high level quality.  Sales goals, marketing goals, product goals, engineering goals, and even our features are all irrelevant to the user experiencing an issue here and now. 

In the user experience world, this applies to quality empty and error states.
In the development and engineering world, this applies to high levels of site reliability engineering: resiliency, awareness and performance.

## We often dismiss small changes because they don’t seem to matter very much in the moment

**Atomic Habits**:  

**Tech Product**:  : 
- Momentum, momentum, momentum.  Every little change matters and adds up to a growing snowball effect. This is true both in subtle enhancements to the user experience as well as internal processes.

- "It may be better but we have more important issues"

## It’s only by making the fundamentals of life easier that you can create the mental space needed for free thinking and creativity

This may be the most important one when applied in the technology world.  The product will struggle to evolve and be successful if engineers are spending time fighting fires and struggling to release code consistently.  The foundations (CI/CD, DevOps, Site Reliability and team enablement) need to be put in place early and often to ensure the team can focus on free thinking and creativity to solve _human_ problems.
