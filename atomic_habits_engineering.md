# Atomic Habits in Building Software

Can you count how many layers there are now in software products?  3, 4, 10?  So many!   From our code, to third party libraries, to machine code, to cloud providers, to operating systems, to hardware there is no shortage of layers and complexities.  Us engineers maintaining production systems quickly appreciate diving into the layers identifying root causes for effective resolutions as opposed to playing whack a mole on symptom level issues.  This is why I love James Clear's Atomic Habits, he identifies the root cause when it comes to hacking improvement patterns into our own biological systems by focusing first on habit change.

> If you are as interested as I am in self improvement, I highly recommend grabbing the book and enjoying the ride.  Additionally Hidden Brain has a great episode on the topic (linked below). 

From here we'll have some fun taking the most powerful messages of the book and applying them to the vast world of and software engineering and providing value through software.

## You do not rise to the level of your goals.  You fall to the level of your systems

> In atomic habits, systems in the quote refers to our biologically developed *habitual systems*

This quote systems refers to our *habitual systems*.  Our habitual systems perform common tasks while we ourselves are often on auto-pilot.  For example, the abi while we Goals are an end-result to changing our habits.  When we accomplish our goals what we have actually done is changed our habits for the better.  For example, if your goal is to lose 10 lbs.   

**Atomic Habits**:  As aspirational as our goals and commitments are,  research has shown what truly drives change is our habits.  Habits developed incrementally over time are performed on auto-pilot, therefore inevitably as our resolve deteriorates, our habits kicked in.  The optimized route for introducing effective change into our life therefore is to introduce change into our habitual system.  For example, focus your primary attention on exercising 15 minutes in the morning before coffee _instead_ of focusing on a goal to lose to "20 lbs".  Drive change in your habitual system to fulfill your goals. 

**Tech Product**:  Your system is as strong as your weakest link.   Our product does not rise to the level of our incredible features (goals) but will fall to the level of our system (our defects and site reliability).  It is imperative that we maintain a high level quality.  Sales goals, marketing goals, product goals, engineering goals, and even our features are all irrelevant to the user experiencing an issue here and now. 

In the user experience world, this applies to quality empty and error states.
In the development and engineering world, this applies to high levels of site reliability engineering: resiliency, awareness and performance.

**You as a programmer**:  Applying this more personally, we all have aspirations as programmers: writing more tests, cleaner code, using more automation and many more.  Approaching this from a habits perspective let's train our autonomous habitual system to help us.  

- In writing more tests, we can inject a habit of writing a test for ever defect we fix, the test is first failing and the passes after we modify the code, validating the bug fix.  
- In using more automation for cloud resources, we can inject a habit to first review the code documentation (terraform or otherwise) before creating the resource. 
- In writing cleaner code, inject a habit before every new work item spend 15 minutes consuming clean code and architecture content.  

There absolutely is work to grow the skills required to perform these tasks and this does not belittle those efforts.  The important change here is the lens we use to approach the problem.   Analyze our own coding habits, how do we approach problems and what can we tweak that will reinforce behavior to accomplish our goals?  Alter _our habits_ to achieve the goals.

## We often dismiss small changes because they don’t seem to matter very much in the moment

**Atomic Habits**:  

**Tech Product**:  : 
- Momentum, momentum, momentum.  Every little change matters and adds up to a growing snowball effect. This is true both in subtle enhancements to the user experience as well as internal processes.

## It’s only by making the fundamentals of life easier that you can create the mental space needed for free thinking and creativity

This may be the most important one when applied in the technology world.  The product will struggle to evolve and be successful if engineers are spending time fighting fires and struggling to release code consistently.  The foundations (CI/CD, DevOps, Site Reliability and team enablement) need to be put in place early and often to ensure the team can focus on free thinking and creativity to solve _human_ problems. 

## Before we can effectively build new habits, we need to get a handle on our current ones

This is important lesson in scope creep and prioritization.  Before a product adds new features we need to ensure the existing ones are working effectively, this can include both user value/adoption and reliability .  If they are not being adopted, we could even consider removing them to lower the overall care and feeding "cost" prior to adding new features.  

## One of the most effective things you can do to build better habits is to join a culture where your desired behavior is the normal behavior

> Culture Eats Strategy for Breakfast.

Culture is HUGE.  Focus on improving the culture.  It's hard to introduce positive change if you're the organization is not open to receiving it.

## It is easy to get bogged down trying to find the optimal plan for change: the fastest way to lose weight, the best program to build muscle, the perfect idea for a side hustle.  We are so focused on figuring out the best approach that we never get around to taking action


MVP, Agile: small iterative progress.  What we believe may be most valuable to the users may end up evolving to something completely different, slowly work your way there, adapting quickly so it looks like it is what you planned all along.


## Standardize before you optimize.  You can’t improve a habit that doesn’t exist

In the technology world, optimize often means automation.  And you cannot automate without standardizing.

## The human brain evolved to prioritize immediate rewards over delayed rewards

Be aware of the long term ramifications of quick wins.  They may prove valuable for the right reasons but make sure you understand the pro's and con's before blindly plowing forward.

## Your  outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits.
